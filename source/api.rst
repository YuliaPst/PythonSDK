API Reference
=============

This section provides detailed documentation for the USNAN SDK API endpoints and their JSON responses.

Overview
--------

The endpoints provide access to different data objects within NAN. In this initial release, that includes:

 * Datasets (also known as experiments) (:class:`usnan.models.datasets.Dataset`)
 * Facilities (:class:`usnan.models.facilities.Facility`)
 * Spectrometers (also known as spectrometers) (:class:`usnan.models.spectrometers.Spectrometer`)
 * Probes (:class:`usnan.models.probes.Probe`)

Furthermore, some of these data objects have other data objects embedded inside of them. For example, a facility object
has staff objects associated with it. These embedded objects are implemented as Python dataclasses in the SDK models
and their JSON structure is documented in the respective endpoint sections below.

Dataset Fetch Endpoint
----------------------

* ``GET /nan/public/datasets/{dataset_id}`` - Retrieve a specific dataset by ID

**Response Fields:**

* ``id`` (integer) - The unique ID of the dataset. Note that this ID refers to a specific *version* of a dataset. (Which may be the original version.)
* ``identifier`` (string) - The identifier of the dataset more broadly - allowing access to all versions of the dataset. This is used to generate the unique ARK records for a dataset.
* ``classification`` (string) - An optional classification value entered by the user. Chosen from the following: ``"Calibration experiment", "Failed-sample related", "Failed-instrument related", "Failed-setup related", "Successful experiment", "Test experiment"``
* ``dataset_name`` (string) - The name of the dataset, which can be edited by the user. If the user has edited the name, this will be a more human-readable name than the `experiment_name` which is set automatically and is immutable.
* ``decoupling_sequence`` (string) - The name of the decoupling sequence used in the experiment.
* ``experiment_end_time`` (string) - The end date and time (with timezone) of the experiment.
* ``experiment_name`` (string) - The name of the experiment as ran on the spectrometer. May not be edited.
* ``experiment_start_time`` (string) - The start date and time (with timezone) of the experiment.
* ``facility_identifier`` (string) - The identifier of the facility the experiment was ran in.
* ``is_knowledgebase`` (boolean) - Whether or not the dataset has been marked as a knowledgebase.
* ``is_locked`` (boolean) - A boolean (yes/no) describing if the sample was locked on a deuterated solvent during the experiment collection.
* ``is_multi_receiver`` (boolean) - [Add description]
* ``is_non_uniform`` (boolean) - A boolean (yes/no) if the experiment was collected with non-uniform sampling.
* ``mas_rate`` (float) - The magic angle spinning rate in kHz, if applicable.
* ``mixing_sequence`` (string) - The name of the mixing sequence used in the experiment, if applicable.
* ``mixing_time`` (float) - The lenght of time (seconds) of the applied mixing sequence, if applicable.
* ``notes`` (string) - Arbitrary text notes on the dataset entered by the user.
* ``num_dimension`` (integer) - The total number of dimensions defined in the pulse program.
* ``num_dimension_collected`` (integer) - The number of dimensions that were actually collected during acquisition.
* ``number_in_set`` (integer) - Often multiple experiments are ran with the same `experiment_name` but only one is the actual experiment, whereas the others are calibrations or tests. This indicates how many experiments were ran in a row with the same `experiment_name`. Usually, only one of these experiments will be marked as `preferred` - the non-preferred experiments are hidden by default.
* ``preferred`` (boolean) - Whether or not the dataset has been marked as preferred out of a set. See `number_in_set` above.
* ``pi_name`` (string) - The name of the principal investigator who has authority over the dataset.
* ``public_time`` (string) - The date and time (with timezone) the dataset will become or has become public. As the current endpoint only support unauthenticated access, this will always be in the past.
* ``published_time`` (string) - The date and time (with timezone) that the dataset was published. Publishing creates an immutable copy of the metadata and data of the dataset and causes an `ARK <https://arks.org/>`_ record to be issued. Published datasets are issued a version number to allow individual published versions to be referenced.
* ``pulse_sequence`` (string) - The name of the pulse program used to collect the experiment.
* ``sample_id`` (integer) - The ID of the sample linked to the dataset.
* ``sample_sparsity`` (float) - Percentage of acquired points (0–100%). A value of 100% indicates a fully sampled dataset. A value of less then 100% indicates a non-uniformly sampled (NUS) experiment.
* ``session_id`` (integer) - A unique session identifier. This can be used to locate other experiments ran before or after a given experiment on the same spectrometer by the same user.
* ``solvent`` (string) - The deuterated solvent used when collecting the experiment.
* ``source`` (string) - Whether the dataset was captured directly by NDTS (`NDTS-auto`), whether it was manually uploaded later from the spectrometer by a facility manager (`NDTS-manual`), or whether it was uploaded via the web GUI by an arbitrary user (`NAN-arbitrary`)
* ``spectrometer_identifier`` (string) - The identifier of the spectromter the experiment was ran on. Can be used to look up the spectrometer information.
* ``state`` (string) - Identifies the experiment as solid state or solution state.
* ``tags`` (string[]) - Arbitrary text tags associated with the experiment for user convenience.
* ``temperature_k`` (float) - The temperature the spectrometer recorded the experiment was ran at.
* ``time_shared`` (boolean) - A pulse sequence is designed to generate multiple independent spectra within a single experiment by alternating transfer pathways.
* ``title`` (string) - The title of the experiment. Set by the user, this is a formal title for a dataset.
* ``version`` (string) - The version of the dataset. Null for original datasets, set to a non-zero increasing number for published datasets.
* ``z0_drift_correction`` (boolean) - States the user defined Z0 drift correction for an experiment collected in an unlocked state.

**Dimension Object Fields:**

* ``dimension`` (integer) - Identifies the dimension order.
* ``nucleus`` (string) - The nucleus observed in this dimension (e.g., "1H", "13C").

* ``spectral_width_ppm`` (float) - The spectral width of this dimension in parts per million (ppm).
* ``maximum_evolution_time`` (float) - The maximum evolution time for this dimension (in seconds).
* ``num_points`` (integer) - The number of acquired points in this dimension.

**Version Object Fields:**

* ``id`` (integer) - The identifier of the dataset with the version specified.
* ``version`` (integer) - The version of the dataset with the id above.

The version object allows you to look up other versions of a given dataset.

Dataset Search Endpoint
-----------------------

* ``GET /nan/public/datasets/search`` - Search for datasets using various filters

Parameters:

* ``filters`` (json) - A dictionary of search filter configurations, JSON encoded. Details below.
